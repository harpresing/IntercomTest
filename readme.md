### Intercom - Software Engineer - Take home test

1. My proudest Achievement is described in the file - `significantAchievement.md`
2. Flatten an array of arbitrarily nested arrays of integers into a flat array of integers <br>
	+ `flatten.py` - Requirements - python 2.7 
	+ When you run ```$ python flatten.py```, it will flatten `[1, 3, 434, [[[234]]], 2, 4, [[2, 9]]]` to 
`[1, 3, 434, 234, 2, 4, 2, 9]`, you can change the array to be flattened in the script
	+ `flattenTest.py` - contains a testsuite for flatten.py. Run it as `$ python flattenTest.py`.<br> Run individual tests as: `$ python flattenTest.py FlattenTest.<test name>` Where you can replace `<test name>` by any test method in the testsuite
3. Program that reads the full list of customers and output the names and user ids of matching customers (within 100km), sorted by User ID (ascending)
	+ `lunch.py` - Requirements - python 2.7
	+ When you run ```$ python lunch.py``` it reads the customer list from the file `customers.json` which is exactly the same as the one [here](https://gist.github.com/brianw/19896c50afa89ad4dec3) and outputs customers within 100 Km
	+ `lunchTest.py` - contains a testsuite for lunch.py. Run it as `$ python lunchTest.py`.<br> To run individual tests, issue the command : `$ python lunchTest.py LunchTest.<test name>` Where you can replace `<test name>` by any test method in the testsuite
